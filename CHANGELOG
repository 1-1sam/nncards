1.0 -> 2.0
Changes:
  - More key controls:
      Right Arrow, l: Next card
      Left Arrow, j: Previous card
      Space, Up/Down Arrow: Flip card
      Page Up: First card
      Page Down: Last card
      Escape: Quit nncards
  - Added -c option: Start at nth card (n being the given integer)
  - Cards are now stored on heap rather than stack.
  - There is no longer a 254 character limit on terms/definitions.
  - Default make install PREFIX is now /usr/local rather than /usr.
  - Replace any tabs in the term/definition with spaces. Tabs cause Termbox's
    TUI rendering to freak out.
  - The info bar now only shows the card file name, rather than its full path.
  - nncards will specify which line it cannot parse, if it ever encounters one.
  - Text is cut short if some of its lines would be printed outside the card's
    border.
  - If no argument is passed, nncards prints help message.
