2.0 -> ???

[11/28/23]
 
* Logical evaluations on non-booleans no longer use 'if (foo)' or 'if (!foo)'.

* src/Makefile is now based on ebread's Makefile (another project I'm working
  on). ebread's Makefile was heavily based on mle's Makefile. Changes to the
  Makefile include using patsubst to get object file names, cleaner cflags,
  supporting ldflags, and make clean being handled by src/Makefile rather than
  the root Makefile. make install no longer installs the manual, that now must
  be manually installed :-).

* termbox.h was updated to termbox2.h
